## General Adventuring

---

### Help, I need to make space on my home island!

To help rebuild your home island and create homes for all your residents, you’ll need to get rid of any trees or boulders that are in your way. You can remove these using things like root removers or explosives. There are a few ways to obtain these valuable items:

- Earn them by collecting rewards for playing every day.
- Getting a perfect score on either a Medium or Hard sailing challenge.
- Recycle items worth over 300 coins in the Remaker at Seadog Cove.
- Some side quests will reward you with a root or tree remover.
- Some villagers can be convinced to sell these items (look out for the green ‘sell’ icon above their heads).

### What are Bullhorn Farm’s official opening hours?

Like many hard working farmers, dedicated worker Billy Bullhorn works a long day from 6am until 8pm, every day. If you visit the farm outside of these times you’ll notice that Billy has retired for a well earned rest and even the animals are sleeping.

### Will an item respawn and how long will it take?

If you have collected all of the items on your island or battled all of the monsters you can find, these will respawn once some time has passed. Different items take different amounts of time to reappear, however you should find all cycles complete within 24hrs.

### Can I earn Pearls?

Pearls are available for purchase from the Pearl Market (simply tap the little ‘+’ next to your current Pearl count). However, there are other ways in which you can obtain Pearls by putting in the adventure time:

- You can earn them by collecting rewards for playing every day.
- Recycling items in the Remaker at Seadog Cover —no matter the value of your discarded items, there is always a chance to win some extra Pearls.
- Some rare side quests will reward you with a single Pearl.
- Some of the main quests will reward you with quite a few extra pearls!
- Taking on some of the Daily Jobs can reap in some extra Pearls if you can build up a streak.

### Why can’t I see any ads?

During busy periods some ad networks are not able to fulfil all of the requested ad spots.

It's also worth checking:

1. You have ads enabled (Main menu > Settings > Manage Data Settings)
2. If any ad-blockers are installed on your device, these may prevent ads from playing.

### Are the Seabeard severs down?

It’s extremely rare for Seabeard’s servers to experience any downtime, however you can check [this link](http://status.handcircus.com/) to see if there’s a global issue.

## Quest Help

---

### Where can I pick up Taxi Passengers for my quest?

There are Taxi Kiosks on most islands, and on occasion you will see a villager wanting a ride. People will not always need rides, but when they do, they will be waiting and eager to hire you to ferry them to another island.

### Where can I catch a Stonefish?

Stonefish are nocturnal, so you’ll only find this valuable catch between 6pm-4am. They are solo hunters, so you’ll only find them on one island at a time, so be sure to check all coastlines once the sun sets. If you don’t have any luck on your first search, try again in an hour or two.

### Why can’t I complete my side-quest?

Some side-quests require **multiple steps** - such as returning a lost item or delivering a package (or even person!) to a specific location.

To fully complete these side-quests, it’s important to **complete all steps**. This can include returning to whoever gave you the quest in order to **collect your reward** or making sure you **pick up** a hidden item once you find it.

If you have completed a side-quest (and see the green tick mark next to it in the Quest Panel) you have an unlimited amount of time to collect any rewards from the quest giver. However, keep in mind that some characters do move on, so you might need to wait for them to reappear in fully finish things off.

To allow new quests to spawn, any **incomplete** quests will **expire within 24hrs**.

## Account Settings

---

### Can I transfer my game to a new device?

If your current game is connected to a **GameC Center**(iOS) or **Google Play Games** (Android) account, your save data can be easily carried over to a new device. When you install and boot up Seabeard on your new device, you should be able to pick up where you left off. We don´t current support switching from iOS to Android or vice versa. We longer support Facebook, but you can reach out on our <a href="https://discord.gg/2ryHbTKcEEDiscord">Discord channel</a> to ask for help finding your old game data.


### Can I restart my game?

Sadly, to protect player data we are not currently able to provide end users with a feature to erase their current data.

However for players on **iOS**, it is possible to replace your current save by completing the following steps:

- On the device you would like to restart play, log out of Game Centre via the Game Centre app.
- Delete and reinstall the Seabeard app
- Start a new adventure and ensure you complete the first quest (find the root remover).
- Using your Game Centre app, log back in.
- When you return to Seabeard you will be prompted to to select which game save you would like to load (the one you just created locally or the one saved on Game Centre).
- Select your new local save and continue a new adventure!

***Please note*** *that it won't be possible to transfer any purchases from your old game ID to a new game ID.*

### Can I change the time of day?

Some events in Seabeard only happen during the day or night. When you install Seabeard, the game will sync to the local date and time of your device, so wait until it’s dark outside and you’ll see the world of Seabeard change from day to night.

Note that time syncing is currently fixed and cannot be changed once you begin your game (even if your device is moved to a new timezone).

### Can I I play with friends?

There are currently 3 ways you can share your adventure with friends.

**Game Centre (iOS only)** - If you are logged in to Apple's Game Center, those in your Apple network who are already playing Seabeard will also be automatically be added to your friends list.

**Friend code** - every player has their own unique friend code which they can choose to share with other players (without having to use an external social network). To add a friend, simply tap 'Invite Friends' on the Friends panel, enter their friend code and tap the + button.

### My friend has added me but I can’t see them on my Friends List, why?

In order to visit your friend’s island or see them in your list, you must **both** be connected to **each other’s game**.

### Why can’t I add friends?

In line with EU data protection regulations, **players must be over 16 years old** to use our social features. Any player under the age of 16 will not see these features in their game.

## Purchases

---

### Why has my item not been delivered?

Sometimes connection issues can delay processing or prevent purchases from being delivered at all. It's worth double checking you have a strong WiFi/3G/4G connection as this is typically the cause of items not being added.

### I have a problem with a purchase (iOS)

In order to comply with Apple's security processes, all financial transactions are handled directly by Apple and **developers are prohibited from accessing any part of this payment** process.

However, if for any reason you are not happy with a purchase you made in game, you can contact Apple directly to request a refund using their customer service system:

- Visit [https://getsupport.apple.com](https://getsupport.apple.com/)
- Select "Apps & Software"
- Select "App Store"
- Select "Subscriptions & Purchases"
- Select "Request a refund" (You may be asked to log in with your Apple ID)
- Find the purchase for which you would like a refund and tap the 'Report' button next to it
- Select "I'd like to request a refund" from the drop down menu and add any comments (optional)
- Select "Submit"

An Apple Customer Service Representative should then contact you with the follow-up method of your choice.

Unfortunately, Apple does not allow developers to provide refunds directly to players on iOS.

### I have a problem with a purchase (Android)

If for any reason you are not happy with a purchase you made in game (**and you are playing on an Android device**) you can reach out on our <a href="https://discord.gg/2ryHbTKcEEDiscord">Discord channel<a>

## Updates

---

### Will there be any new chapters?

We do hope to add new locations at some point, however for now development is focused on making the current Seabeard as fun as possible. We have TONNES of great ideas we are dying to work on but we are slightly limited by what we can do with the resources we have. Our hope is that by polishing up Seabeard to its absolute best, we will be able to grow our audience big enough to support a bigger team, and then really grow the world to its full potential.

### Have I completed the game?

Some lovely people in the Seabeard community have created a great Wiki with many tips and tricks about the game. If you'd like to double check you've unlocked all of the currently available locations, you can find a complete list here [https://seabeard-game.fandom.com/wiki/Islands](https://seabeard-game.fandom.com/wiki/Islands)

### Is there a bug?

Although Seabeard was originally developed over 6 years ago, we have worked hard to modernise game code where possible and keep it up-to-date with modern devices and platforms.

If you spot a bug that impacts your enjoyment of your adventure, we always welcome player feedback. You can submit feedback by joining our Discord community, where you can also find out about the latest Seabeard news and swap information about the game with other players.
