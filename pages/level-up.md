Life is not a competition, but a little **recognition** for all your hard adventuring is always appreciated!

Whether you’re a master of hunting monster parts or simply love decorating your island, we recognise and reward **all types** of adventures!

Each Trader will also need a place to live, so make sure you've **built enough homes** before offering anyone a job!

### Badges

Equipping your crew in the latest and greatest **gear** not only makes them look snazzy, it will also add to your **Crew Badges**.
