# Making Progress

Throughout your adventure you will encounter many inhabitants in need of assistance or who just want to make friends! There are 3 main types of fun to explore.

## Main Quests

Relating to your overall goals, these quests must be completed in order to **unlock more features or content**.

These are given out by main characters in the game and are highlighted **beneath the crown icon** in the Quest Panel. 

There’s **no time limit** to complete these adventures —they will stay in your Quest Panel until you’ve wrapped up all the tasks.

These quests may appear more than once, and can be used to **earn extra items, experience points and coins**.

If you’re hunting for a specific item, try tapping bushes, shrubs or trees to see if anything shakes free. Again, make sure you return any items to the quest giver to complete the quest and reap your rewards!
